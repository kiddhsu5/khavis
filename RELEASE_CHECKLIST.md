## Phase 0: Pre-Preparation (T-14 to T-7 days)

### Repo housekeeping

- [ ] `git init` if not already initialized
- [ ] `.gitignore` configured (covers `.env`, `__pycache__/`, `*.egg-info/`, `.venv/`, `audit/`, `dist/`, `.DS_Store`)
- [ ] `.dockerignore` configured (excludes `tests/`, `docs/`, `.github/`, `*.md` except `README.md`)
- [ ] All 82 source files committed (no untracked files: `git status` clean)
- [ ] Default branch renamed to `main` (not `master`)
- [ ] Branch protection rules drafted (but **not yet applied** — see Phase 1)

### Legal

- [ ] Apache-2.0 `LICENSE` present and verified (`head -1 LICENSE`)
- [ ] `NOTICE` file present if using third-party brand names (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc. — they are referenced in plugins)
- [ ] No proprietary code, no GPL/LGPL dependencies introduced
- [ ] `SECURITY.md` written (private disclosure email configured — see template in this PR)
- [ ] `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` present (Contributor Covenant v2.1)

### Accounts setup

- [ ] **GitHub** — account created, 2FA enabled (TOTP preferred over SMS)
- [ ] **GitHub org/repo** — `github.com/kiddhsu5/khavis` created (public)
- [ ] **PyPI** — account created at pypi.org, 2FA mandatory since 2024
- [ ] **TestPyPI** — account created at test.pypi.org for dry-runs
- [ ] **Docker Hub** — `kiddhsu` namespace reserved
- [ ] **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)** — enabled at repo settings
- [ ] **Stripe** — account created (for future SaaS tier; do not publish yet)
- [ ] **Twitter/X** — @kiddhsu handle confirmed, bio updated
- [ ] **dev.to** — account created, profile photo + bio
- [ ] **Hacker News** — account with > 5 karma (so you can submit Show HN without delay)
- [ ] **LinkedIn** — profile updated with "open-source maintainer" line

### Domain / branding (optional)

- [ ] `khavis.kiddhsu.taipei` registered (or `khavis.io`) — skip if cost-prohibitive; PyPI + GitHub are sufficient
- [ ] Logo / wordmark designed (Figma, or use a public-domain glyph like `→`)
- [ ] Brand colors picked (we use a single accent — `#0EA5E9` sky-500 — in README)

### Documentation skeleton

- [ ] `README.md` proofread (361 lines, already drafted)
- [ ] `README.zh-TW.md` proofread (361 lines, already drafted)
- [ ] `CONTRIBUTING.md` proofread (247 lines, already drafted)
- [ ] `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` proofread (14,074 bytes, already drafted)
- [ ] `docs/PLUGIN_DEVELOPMENT.md` proofread (10,496 bytes, already drafted)
- [ ] `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` proofread (8,157 bytes, already drafted)
- [ ] `docs/FAQ.md` proofread (8,092 bytes, already drafted)

---

## Phase 1: Final Pre-Launch (T-7 to T-1 day)

### Code quality final pass

- [ ] Run `python3 -m pytest tests/ -v` — target **148+ passing, 0 failing**
- [ ] Run `python3 scripts/test_plugins.py` — expect **12 plugins verified**
- [ ] Run `python3 scripts/integration_test.py` with all env vars set — target **12/12 passing** (BYOK pools skipped if env unset)
- [ ] Run `ruff check .` — expect **0 errors** (warnings allowed, document in `# noqa` if false-positive)
- [ ] Run `mypy core/ providers/` — expect **0 errors** (strict mode optional for first release)
- [ ] Verify test coverage: `pytest --cov=core --cov=providers --cov-report=term-missing`
  - [ ] `core/` ≥ 80% coverage
  - [ ] `providers/` ≥ 60% coverage
- [ ] No TODO/FIXME left in shipped code paths (`grep -r "TODO\|FIXME" core/ providers/ | grep -v ".pyc"`)

### Documentation final review

- [ ] Every `docs/*.md` linked from main README (manual check: grep `docs/` in `README.md`)
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` has dated `## [0.1.0] — 2026-09-XX` section
- [ ] All code examples in README actually run (no dead snippets)
- [ ] All badge URLs in README point to real shields.io endpoints
- [ ] Hero ASCII diagram renders in monospace preview
- [ ] No broken internal links (`markdown-link-check README.md docs/*.md`)

### Docker test

- [ ] `docker build -t khavis:test .` succeeds on **arm64** (Apple Silicon)
- [ ] `docker build -t khavis:test-amd .` succeeds on **amd64** (cloud runner or `docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64`)
- [ ] `docker run --rm khavis:test python3 scripts/test_plugins.py` — 12 plugins verified inside container
- [ ] `docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 khavis:test` — health endpoint responds on `http://localhost:8080/health`
- [ ] Image size < 300 MB (`docker images khavis:test` — verify slim base)

### PyPI dry-run

- [ ] `python3 -m pip install --upgrade build twine`
- [ ] `python3 -m build --sdist --wheel` — both `dist/*.whl` and `dist/*.tar.gz` produced
- [ ] `twine check dist/*` — `PASSED` for both files
- [ ] Upload to TestPyPI: `twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*`
- [ ] Verify install: `pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ K.H.A.V.I.S.`
- [ ] Run `khavis --version` from the TestPyPI install — expect `0.1.0`

### Secrets configuration

- [ ] **GitHub repo secrets** (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):
  - [ ] `PYPI_API_TOKEN` — set, OR configure **trusted publishing** (OIDC) per https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/
  - [ ] `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` — `kiddhsu`
  - [ ] `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` — generated at hub.docker.com → Account Settings → Security
  - [ ] `INTEGRATION_OPENAI_KEY` — optional, for nightly integration tests
  - [ ] `INTEGRATION_ANTHROPIC_KEY` — optional
  - [ ] `INTEGRATION_GEMINI_KEY` — optional
- [ ] **GitHub branch protection on `main`**:
  - [ ] Require pull request reviews before merging (1 approval minimum)
  - [ ] Require status checks to pass before merging (CI must be green)
  - [ ] Require linear history (no merge commits)
  - [ ] Include administrators (apply rules to yourself — yes, even solo)
  - [ ] Allow force pushes: **disabled**
  - [ ] Allow deletions: **disabled**

### First release commit

- [ ] Stage all files: `git add -A`
- [ ] Verify staged diff: `git diff --cached --stat` — should show README, CHANGELOG, docs/, .github/, source files
- [ ] Use commit message from `docs/COMMITS.md` (or, if missing, follow Conventional Commits):
  ```
  chore(release): v0.1.0 — initial public release

  - 11 verified LLM provider plugins
  - 132 passing tests
  - Capability-based routing (prefer/fallback/forbid/require)
  - Hot-reloadable YAML config

  ```
- [ ] Commit signed: `git commit -S -m "..."`
- [ ] Tag signed: `git tag -s v0.1.0 -m "v0.1.0 — initial public release"`
- [ ] Verify tag signature: `git tag -v v0.1.0`
- [ ] Push branch: `git push origin main`
- [ ] Push tag: `git push origin v0.1.0` — **this triggers the release workflow**

### Final sanity checks (T-1 day, evening)

- [ ] `git log --oneline -10` — history clean, no "wip" commits
- [ ] `git tag --list` — `v0.1.0` present, signed
- [ ] GitHub Actions green: `https://github.com/kiddhsu5/khavis/actions`
- [ ] TestPyPI install command tested one more time
- [ ] Docker image built and tested one more time
- [ ] Phone silenced, calendar blocked 9 AM–noon tomorrow for launch
- [ ] Go to bed at a reasonable hour

## Failure Modes & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| **Nobody shows up on HN** | Medium | Low | Pre-schedule Twitter, dev.to, and Reddit posts so launch isn't HN-or-bust |
| **Too much HN traffic, site crashes** | Low | Medium | GitHub Pages static, no server-side load; PyPI handles their own |
| **Critical bug at launch** | Medium | High | v0.1.1 hotfix procedure documented (Day 2-3); branch protection catches most |
| **Competitor launches similar tool** | High | Low | Focus on community, ship v0.2.0 faster than they ship |
| **Security issue reported** | Low | Critical | Private disclosure via SECURITY.md; private email + GitHub Security Advisories |
| **Maintainer burnout** | Medium | High | Set clear "response within 48h" expectation; no on-call; block weekends |
| **Brand-name DMCA complaint** | Low | Medium | NOTICE file attributes all trademarks; polite takedown process |
| **PyPI name squatted** | Very Low | Critical | Verify `pip install khavis` works 7 days before launch (TestPyPI dry-run) |
| **GitHub org name squatted** | Very Low | Critical | Reserve `kiddhsu/khavis` 14 days before launch |

---

## Success Criteria at 90 Days

## Appendix A: Communication Templates

### Show HN first comment template

```
Thanks for checking this out. A few notes for anyone evaluating it:

1. **Why BYOK**: Most "AI gateways" proxy your keys and bill you markup.
   khavis uses your keys directly — no middleman, no markup, no
   quota-sharing with strangers.

2. **Why capability routing**: Instead of "always use GPT-4", you declare
   what you need (`prefer: code`, `fallback: cheap`) and the router
   picks from your pools. Works like DNS, but for LLMs.

3. **Why hot reload**: Edit `pools.yaml` while the server is running.
   No restart, no dropped requests.

4. **What's next**: Multi-provider load balancing (v0.2.0), semantic
   caching (v0.2.0), cost analytics (v0.3.0).

AMA in the comments. — Kidd
```

### Bug-triage response template

```
Thanks for the report! Reproducing now. Could you paste:

1. Output of `khavis --version`
2. The exact command that failed
3. The full traceback (if any)
4. Your `pools.yaml` (redact keys)

Will triage within 24h.
```

### Hotfix announcement template (Twitter)

```
v0.1.1 just shipped — fixes [issue #N] where [one-sentence symptom].
Upgrade with `pip install --upgrade khavis` or pull `:0.1.1` from
Docker Hub. No breaking changes. Thanks to @<reporter> for the report.
```
