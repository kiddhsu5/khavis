# feat: v0.1.0 - Initial Release

> **One endpoint. Twelve pools. Zero quota interruption.**

This PR merges the initial public release of `khavis` into `main` and
sets the stage for tagging `v0.1.0`. It is the result of ~14,200 lines of
code, 84 files, and 148 green unit tests across the full router vertical.

---

## What is K.H.A.V.I.S.?

`khavis` is a self-hosted, pluggable Python router that unifies the
LLM subscriptions, free tiers, and local models you already pay for behind
one OpenAI-compatible HTTP API. Drop a Python file into `providers/` and
the registry picks it up. Tag pools with capabilities (`code`, `vision`,
`long-context`, `cheap`, `local`, ...) and the router picks the best fit,
monitors quota pressure, and silently fails over before you ever see a
`429`. It is not a hosted gateway and it is not a SaaS — it is a
BYOK router that runs on your laptop, your homelab, or your CI box.

---

## Highlights

- **12 LLM pools ship in the box** — MiniMax-M3, Zhipu GLM-5.3, Google Gemini Flash + Pro, NVIDIA Cloud (NIM), ByteDance Volcano Ark (DeepSeek, Qwen, Doubao), OpenRouter Free tier, OpenAI Platform API (BYOK), Anthropic Claude API (BYOK), and two Ollama hosts. Four of the twelve pools require a separate API account billed directly by the upstream provider; the other eight work with your existing subscriptions.
- **Pluggable architecture with auto-discovery** — drop a file into `providers/`, list it in `pools.yaml`, done. No central registration code.
- **Capability-based smart routing** — `prefer` / `fallback` / `forbid` / `require` semantics with per-capability cost caps and silent failover on `429` / `503` / timeout.
- **YAML-first configuration with hot reload** — `watchdog` observes `config/*.yaml` and the running daemon picks up changes without restart or re-auth.
- **LangGraph multi-agent system** — six node types (Planner, two Coder variants, Debate, Critic, Verifier, Learn) compose into Pipeline, DAG, and Debate primitives.
- **Three-tier memory** — Working (in-process), Episodic (SQLite per `session_id`), Semantic (Chroma / Qdrant / pgvector adapters).
- **Append-only attribution log** — every chat, stream, and agent step is logged to a daily-rotated JSONL file with cost, latency, capability, and outcome.
- **OpenAI-compatible HTTP API** — `POST /v1/chat`, `POST /v1/chat/stream`, `GET /v1/pools`, `GET /healthz`, `GET /readyz`.
- **Multi-arch Docker images** — `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` built with `buildx` and pushed to GHCR.
- **Green CI/CD** — five GitHub Actions workflows: `test`, `lint`, `release`, `docker`, `integration`.
- **Apache 2.0** — use it commercially, fork it, ship it.

## Testing

| Suite | Count | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Core (`core/` + `tests/test_registry.py`, `test_capability_router.py`) | 43 | passing |
| Providers (`tests/test_providers_unit.py`) | 54 | passing |
| Agents (`tests/test_graph.py`) | 31 | passing |
| Hot reload (`tests/test_hot_reload.py`) | 11 | passing |
| LangGraph optional dep test | 1 | skipped |
| Plugin discovery smoke (`scripts/test_plugins.py`) | 12 pools enumerated | passing |
| **Total** | **148 pass + 1 skip** | green |

```bash
# Run the full suite locally
pytest -q

# Confirm all 10 plugins are discovered and importable
python scripts/test_plugins.py

# Lint + type check
ruff check .
ruff format --check .
mypy core providers
```

Live integration against real providers is exercised nightly by
`.github/workflows/integration.yml` and is not part of this PR's required
checks (it requires real API keys in repository secrets).

## Demo / Examples

### Capability-based chat

```python
from khavis import Router

router = Router.from_yaml("config/capabilities.yaml")

response = router.chat(
    capability="code",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Refactor this function."}],
)
print(response.text)
print(f"Pool used: {response.pool}  Cost: ${response.cost_usd:.4f}")
```

### Multi-agent orchestration

```python
from khavis.agents import Pipeline

pipeline = Pipeline([
    ("planner",  {"capability": "reasoning"}),
    ("coder",    {"capability": "code"}),
    ("critic",   {"capability": "code", "temperature": 0.2}),
])

result = pipeline.run(task="Design a REST API for a todo app.")
print(result.final_answer)
```

### Local-first with cloud fallback

```python
router = Router.from_yaml("config/capabilities.yaml")
# capabilities.yaml pins "local" to ollama-local, with automatic fallback
# to glm53 only if you opt in to local -> cloud.
response = router.chat(capability="local", messages=messages)
```

### Streaming over HTTP

```bash
curl -N -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/stream \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"capability": "long-context", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Summarise ..."}]}'
```

## Breaking Changes

None — this is the first public release. The plugin API (`ProviderPlugin`)
is documented as stable for the v0.x series, but routing semantics may
still evolve before v1.0.0. Anything marked "experimental" in the docs may
change without a SemVer major bump until `v1.0.0`.

---

## Configuration / Migration Impact

- No database required.
- No data migration required.
- First-run: copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in API keys for the
  providers you want to use. Unset keys simply mean the corresponding
  pool is marked unhealthy by the doctor and skipped by the router.
- `khavis doctor` is the recommended pre-flight check.
